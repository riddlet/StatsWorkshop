## Strategy

Last time, we used Mark's data to illustrate loading data, some details about variable/object types, basic use of the `reshape2` package, and a few preliminary plots, made with ggplot.

Today, Maya has been nice enough to donate her data to the cause.  We're going to use her data to accomplish our objectives.  Specifically, we're going to

- Clean it up a bit
- Make some plots to discover some relationships
- think about ANOVA

## Material

Practically, we're going to rehash some of the stuff from last time.  As far as R is concerned, I don't think there's anything in here that isn't stuff we didn't cover last time, but feel free to stop me with questions.

## A brief point about outliers

>  - What do I do with my outliers?
>  - A few options:
>     - exclude
>     - ignore
>     - run analyses with and without

>  - As far as I can tell, this seems to be a matter of preference/what your advisor did.

## Outliers

>  - I'm going to argue for a specific approach
>  - Think about *why* that outlier is an outlier

## Load in Data

In Maya's R script, she first loads in her data:
```{r}
srp <- read.csv('../Data/SR.Past.Rel.12.10.14.csv')
```

After this, she goes on to calculate some index measures and clean the file up a bit.  I've omitted that code here.  However, I'll highlight one thing she did

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#### EXCLUSIONS ####
#exclude 5 who copied the Michael text verbatim (exclcopied=1)
srp <- srp[ which(is.na(srp$exclcopied) == TRUE ), ]
#exclude 11 who used 'Michael' in their message (didn't follow directions) (exclmich=1)
srp <- srp[ which(is.na(srp$exclmich) == TRUE ), ]

#### RECODING ####

####renaming manipulations 
#install.packages("reshape")
library(reshape)
library(reshape)
srp <- rename(srp, c(DO.BR.FL_19="relprime")) #dissolved=1, stable=2
srp <- rename(srp, c(DO.BR.FL_20="attitude")) #like=2, dislike=1
```


## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1

srp$attitudedum[srp$attitude == "Michael-Dislike"] <- 0
srp$attitudedum[srp$attitude == "Michael-Like"] <- 1
```

Here, we're making a new variable which is a dummy code of another variable (i.e. code the two categories as 1 and zero).  Let's look a little more closely at what's going on here.

## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1
```


> - We select the dataframe 

> - `srp` 

> - We indicate the column we want within that dataframe 

> - `srp$relprimedum` 

## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1
```

`srp$relprimedum` is a column that didn't exist before, so when we do this, we are telling R to create a new variable with that name.


## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1
```
So, new variable.  What now?

> - Fill it in with zeros! 

> - `srp$relprimedum ... <- 0`

## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1
```
But there's other stuff present, right?  What's it doing?

`srp$relprimedum ... <- 0`

> - If we just ran the following, we would have a long vector of zeros

> - `srp$relprimedum <- 0`

## Dummy coding manipulations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"] <- 0
srp$relprimedum[srp$relprime == "Dissolved Relationship Priming"] <- 1
```
But zeros aren't that useful to us.  We want zeros and ones.  Specifically,  we want zeros for people who had stable relationship primes, and ones for those who had dissolved relationship priming.

This is what the bit in brackets is doing

> - `srp$relprime == "Stable Relationship Priming"`

> - This returns a bunch of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values.

> - When we plug these *boolean* values into the rows of the new variable that we're assigning values to (using bracket notation), it will only assign values to those that take a value of `TRUE`. 

## Subset & Plot

But is this process really necessary?  After this, Maya goes on to create subsets of her data so that she can plot them, like this:

```{r}
###### SUBSETTING ####
srlike <- subset(srp, attitudedum==1)
srdislike <- subset(srp, attitudedum==0)
srstable <- subset(srp, relprimedum==0)
srdissolve <- subset(srp, relprimedum==1)
```

## Subset & Plot

But is this process really necessary?  After this, Maya goes on to create subsets of her data so that she can plot them, like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14)) #for all graphs to have bw background & same font size
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(srlike, aes(x=vmessage)) + 
  geom_density()
```


## Subset & Plot

And then:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(srdislike, aes(x=vmessage)) + 
  geom_density()
```

## Subset & Plot
Why do we plot?  To answer questions about the data..

> - Normally distributed? 
>     - Basically.
> - Difference between like & dislike? 
>     - Hard to tell...


## Subset & Plot
We can kill three birds with one stone here by:

1.  Just using the original variable (stored as a factor)

2.  Omitting the subsetting step

3.  Putting both conditions on the same plot

```{r}
str(srp$attitude)
```

R handles factors pretty intelligently.  We might have to fiddle with them on occasion, but in this case, it should work fine.

## Subset & Plot
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vmessage, color=attitude))
plot + geom_density()
```

## More Plotting

What we're doing is examining the influence of two separate IV's on two DV's.  So, although we could make four plots like the one above (one for combination of IV & DV), we can simplify this even *more* by putting both IVs on the same plot.

## More Plotting
For the vRecall DV:
```{r, fig.height=4}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vrecall, color=attitude))
plot + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~relprime)
```

## More Plotting
For the vMessage DV:
```{r, fig.height=4}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vmessage, color=attitude))
plot + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~relprime)
```

## More Plotting
```{r, fig.height=3}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vmessage, color=attitude))
plot + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~relprime)
```

The utitity of plotting shows itself!  That spike for dissolved priming certainly looks a little odd, don't you think?  Let's just make sure there's nothing weird about the data...

## Check the data {.smaller}
We can print out a nice table of the values:

```{r}
with(srp[srp$relprime == 'Dissolved Relationship Priming',], 
     table(vmessage, attitude))
```

## Check the data
So we saw that nine people selected the .5 option for that group.  This is certainly a lot, but I don't feel like it suggests that anything fishy is going on.

## Check the data
In Maya's original script, we next examined a correlation coefficient for the relationship between vrecall and vmessage

>  - Why?
>      - Presumably, because we're interested in the relationship


## Check the data {.smaller}

```{r}
cor.test(srstable$vmessage, srstable$vrecall) 
```

## Check the data {.smaller}

```{r}
cor.test(srdissolve$vmessage, srdissolve$vrecall) 
```

## Check the data

>  - What do we know?
>      - The data are significantly correlated.
>  - What do we not know?
>      - The nature of the correlation (i.e. what is the relationship?)

## Check the data {.smaller}

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG('../Images/Anscombe.png')
grid.raster(img)
```

>  - All four datasets have the same correlation.
>  - If we want to know about the relationship, we need to look at the data

## Check the data {.smaller}

Clear, strong, and positive relationship.  No funny business.
```{r, fig.height=3.5}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vmessage, y=vrecall))
plot + geom_point(position=position_jitter())
```

Does this relationship differ by condition?

## Check the data {.smaller}

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
plot <- ggplot(srp, aes(x=vmessage, y=vrecall))
plot + geom_point(position=position_jitter()) + facet_grid(attitude~relprime)
```

No difference in relationship, but there might be something else....

## Recap

>  - What you do with your outliers depend on **why** it is an outlier in the first place
>     - Measurement error/data entry mistake?
>     - Legitimate data point?
