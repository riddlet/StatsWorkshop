StatsWorkshop
=============
These are the files used in the creation of the stats workshop run for graduate students.  I haven't included data here, since it isn't mine and I don't have permission to share the data (with the exception of the menustat.org data).  The directories are:

**Data & Images**  
This should be self-explanatory
  
**Sessions**  
These directories contain information for each of the sessions.  Inside you will find several documents.  The pretty things will be the two html files - one for presentation and one which is kind of a reading.  

The .Rmd and .Rpres files are the documents used to generate the html files described above.
  
If you'd like to examine any of this, you can click on the link on the right which says 'download zip'.  This will download this entire directory as a zip file.  After unzipping, you should be able to view the .html or .Rmd and .Rpres documents in a web browser or Rstudio, respectively.
