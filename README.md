StatsWorkshop
=============
These are the files used in the creation of the stats workshop run for graduate students.  I haven't included data here, since it isn't mine and I don't have permission to share the data (with the exception of the menustat.org data).  The main files are::
  
**1.  Session 1.Rmd**  
  This is the Rmarkdown file used to explore the data in session 1.
  
**2.  Session_1.docx / session_1.html / session_1.pdf**  
  These are the output files generated when running the markdown document
  
Data and images can be found in their respective folders
